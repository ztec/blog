Zed's place
==========

This repository contains source code of my personal blog https://blog.ztec.fr


### Contribution

Contribution are welcome as long as they do not alter the meaning
of the content. If you rather comment, you can go directly on https://blog.ztec.fr, find the page and use the comment 
section.

If you want to suggest a grammar, spelling or typo fix, this is the place. Please open a PullRequest. I will be
happy to merge it as long as you do not alter the original meaning of the text.

I plan to add contributors names on article pages where they contributed. This is not in place for now, but consider
it. If you want to suggest modification anonymously, send me a git patch via mail using patch.blog@riper.fr
