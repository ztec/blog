Hey! I'm **Loïc**, also known as **Ztec** (or **Zed**).

I'm a dev/architect/DevOps/SRE, naturally curious and passionate about all things code and systems. I love understanding how things work and sharing what I learn on [blog.ztec.fr](https://blog.ztec.fr).

[//]: # (When I'm not coding, I'm usually holding a camera, capturing whatever catches my eye. You can find my photos on [photos.ztec.fr]&#40;https://photos.ztec.fr&#41;.)

If you want to know more, there's a [whoami](https://www.ztec.fr/whoami) page for that.
You can also check out my [professional experience](https://www.ztec.fr/experience-pro) or find me on [social media](https://www.ztec.fr/social).
