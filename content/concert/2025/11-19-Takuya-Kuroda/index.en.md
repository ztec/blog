Second time for me seeing Takuya Kuroda and his band at New Morning.
Still as classy and jazzy as ever. Each story is delightfully told through
music, easy to follow.

Those guys are pro, precise and fluid. They know their stuff.

The electro/jazz mix is still as good.

Takuya Kuroda san told the story about the track "[Car 16 15 A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8vr1QvOMKw)" like last time.
Always a pleasure to listen to it, especially live where the band takes time
to develop each movement. A little preview on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8vr1QvOMKw) for the curious, but
live is by far even better.



The Crowd Breakdown: Diverse and young. A few tourists as usual. I had the opportunity to talk to a Japanese lady
and exchange a few recommendations. It was really nice. As always at New Morning, people stay standing and move well.
Don't forget it's jazz, no pogos!
