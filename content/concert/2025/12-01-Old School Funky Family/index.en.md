Discovery of the day: Old School Funky Family at {{<link "places/le duc des lombards">}}. A rare occasion as they
don't come to Paris often.

Lots and lots of energy, fun, and enjoyment. The pyjama style is fun and perfectly matches the chill & joyful vibe they created.

It's obvious that all members of the band really enjoy playing together. Lots of chemistry and interactions between them.
The audience isn't forgotten either, and they managed to get people standing up at the Duc, a cool but somewhat stuffy place.

On the musical side, it's fun and funk. A bit of big band sometimes but without fanfare. Electro and classic
jazz mix together neatly. The {{<link "instruments/sousaphone">}} is really nice. Never heard of it before. I like it.
The Duc removed the enormous grand piano that usually takes half the stage to make all 8 (eight!!!) musicians fit.

A few listening tracks to discover:
- [Bamboche & Chaloupade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OM7_UpLlYA) (YouTube)
- [Ceci Est Une Patate !](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCymfQgakqg) (YouTube)
- [Le Bon, La Brute et Le Centriste](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAvhasdmtBs) (YouTube)
- and on usual streaming platforms.


I strongly recommend listening to them, but most importantly, go see them live if you can. The experience is way better than albums.
So much more energy. You can go without hesitation, I assure you.

They remind me of another band with a different style but the same energy on stage: {{< link "/artists/Who parked the car" >}}. They're also
cramped on small stages (especially at Sunset Sunside) due to the number of people, but they have so much energy it's really nice to experience.

The Crowd Breakdown: Diverse and young. As usual at the Duc, there's always a fair amount of tourists. Overall, the audience
was really diverse in all aspects. I often do a quick sweep of the crowd at concerts I attend. I'm looking for obvious demographic over-representation,
or lack thereof. Absolutely not scientific at all, but it's interesting and fun to know who came and if you feel you fit in. In jazz, the common
case is to see lots of white dudes over 50. Tonight, that wasn't the case, and it's cool.
