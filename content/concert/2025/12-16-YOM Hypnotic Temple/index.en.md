It starts in complete darkness. We're warned that phones aren't allowed as they would ruin the experience. 
Will this horde of old folks manage to restrain themselves? Yeah. Surprising but yeah, and not a single flash as a result.

Anyway, it starts in the dark.

Two shaved heads (or almost) light up slowly on either side of the stage. We can make out the pianist at the keyboard on the right. 
Then a bit later the clarinetist on the left.

Sitting cross-legged like monks. Dressed in black, only the arms, head, legs, feet and hands are truly highlighted by the lighting.

The music begins with low, muffled sounds that start the enchantment.

In the center, the light gradually reveals the dancer; she's well-haired. 
Motionless at first, she gradually straightens up while starting to dance, spinning. And it'll be like that until the end.



Spinning, spinning, spinning. A short pause in the middle but that's it; quite an achievement.

The stage is bathed in video projection. Both the backdrop and the floor. 
Everything is projected onto black, which tends to fully integrate the artists and especially the dancer, anchoring her in the projected reality.

Musically, it's dreamlike and very intoxicating. A kind of soft trance, like a dream. Lots of repetition, originality, and changes. 
It reminded me of one of my most singular experiences, {{< link "concert/2022/09-12-In C 20 sonneurs" >}}.

I was simply captivated for an hour, and for good reasons. It's this kind of experience that makes me appreciate live concerts.

Something perhaps unique, though if other performances are scheduled, I seriously invite you to attend.
