I keep here a list of all the concerts I've attended since 2021. I try to
document all this to be able to cross-reference who I saw, where, when, and with whom. While in mainstream music
we don't have to wonder much about who was present at a band's concert, in Jazz, musicians
frequently collaborate with other artists, and not always the same ones. Since I have an astronomically inefficient memory,
writing everything down helps me keep track.

By the way, I'll also share my impressions, but not retroactively, only for those added after November 2025. (there will be some
particularly memorable exceptions though)

> The list is not exhaustive as I haven't necessarily remembered or noted everything.
> I know that some events are missing, and I will add them as soon as
> I have enough information to create a complete entry
