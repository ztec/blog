Odo Island


> Afterwards, Yamane presents his findings at an emergency meeting at the Diet Building.
> He presents a photograph of the creature, proposing to call it "Godzilla" after the monster from Odo Island's folklore.
> He states that Godzilla must stand at least 50 meters tall and posits that he is actually a prehistoric semi-aquatic reptile, intermediary between land and marine reptiles.
> Yamane says that the sediment from Godzilla's footprint contained a massive amount of Strontium-90, which could have only have come from a hydrogen bomb.
> Thus, Yamane proposes that repeated recent hydrogen bomb testing in the South Pacific completely destroyed Godzilla's underwater habitat, irradiating him and driving him from his sanctuary.
> After Yamane's presentation, a man from the assembly, Oyama, suggests that the information should not be publicly known. Since Godzilla is the product of nuclear weapons, Oyama says, the truth may strain Japan's already fragile international relations.
> However, a woman representative in the assembly angrily objects to Oyama's suggestion and demands that the truth be revealed. After she insults Oyama, chaos breaks loose in the Diet Building.

> As a scientist and human being, Serizawa says he cannot in good conscience introduce a weapon even more dangerous than nuclear weapons.
>
> Just as Ogata begins to accept Serizawa's refusal, a grim television program appears on the air, showing the devastation and deaths caused by Godzilla, along with prayers for hope and peace.
> Shaken by what he is witnessing, Serizawa ultimately decides to use his last Oxygen Destroyer, but only one time.
> Serizawa then proceeds to destroy his research, knowing that this weapon was almost as dangerous and destructive as Godzilla himself, and that destroying this weapon and all evidence of its existence will be for the betterment of society.
