This is the inaugural loot, the first haul from my exploration. This week's drops: readings, listenings, viewings, and other encounters that gave me XP or made me think.
Whether the drops are fresh or farmed long ago, doesn't matter.

Everything I pick up and share doesn't necessarily reflect my opinions, and at no point does sharing something here mean unconditional support for its
content or its author. However, if I add something to my inventory, it's because I believe it's an interesting item, even if I won't necessarily equip it.

I won't pretend to be objective. The loot is already sorted by my criteria, no need to specify each item's rarity, you'll see what I equip or what I skip.

I won't limit myself to tech drops either.

In form, a simple list of items with sometimes lore when I have something to say other than "it's legendary, go loot it".
As for categories, I'll probably craft them by educated guess. If you have farming spot recommendations, feel free to share them through one of my [networks](https://www.ztec.fr/en/social/).

Last thing, the game is available in French and English. So if you don't have these language packs installed, sorry, you won't be able to understand everything. If some articles have official translations, I'll obviously use them, but it's quite rare.

Alright, let's go:

## Tech

 - [Send this article to your friend who still thinks the cloud is a good idea](https://rameerez.com/send-this-article-to-your-friend-who-still-thinks-the-cloud-is-a-good-idea/)

Cloud this, cloud that. We see it everywhere, and the small company that needs to host 3 peanuts does it by default on one of
the 3 hyperscalers (Google, Amazon, Azure). It's annoying from a GDPR regulation standpoint (because it's incompatible), but also because
it makes many companies complex and dependent on these techs.

The article is good, however it's a bit too one-sided for my taste. A bit as if these techs are never useful. Never in the sense
of statistically insignificant. I think it's more often useful than assumed by the author. However, you need to know how to identify the needs
that justify it and the timing. On this last point, I agree with him that no, we can often do without cloud and the techs are really not
objective on these two aspects (I add that).

Also, using these tools comes with many (good) practices. Particularly concerning development cycles, with for example the almost obligation
to automate deployments, and observability which is almost imposed with patterns rather recognized as effective. And when you know how difficult
it is to have healthy development practices from end to end (from product manager to prod through dev), starting from the base proposed by
cloud also often makes sense. And the fact that Devs and Architects know how to handle them rather well is also a plus.

Basically, it's often useless to do cloud, and a simple CDN is enough to handle the load, with a fairly large server. But it's not necessarily desirable if
good dev practices are not there due to a lack of knowledge, or investment in them. Something that is often somewhat mandatory with cloud.

Ideally, a European GDPR-compliant cloud with mature technical solutions would be best. And having one or two dedicated servers should also
be seen as a good solution rather than being criticized or dismissed as outdated.

## Social

I'm not a drug user, and I never have been. However, I've had my share of bad experiences in Parisian clubs, but that was when I was young.
Like the author, I'm surprised, and pleasantly so, that such positive and respectful spaces can and do exist now. Hoping this becomes normalized.

When you know that associations and activists have been describing exactly what's happening now for surely more than 20 years, it's an angry "we told you so" that comes first. If you
want to know the next predictions, check out [La Quadrature du Net](https://www.laquadrature.net/) for example and their site [Technopolice](https://technopolice.fr/).

## Science and Consciousness

These two links are interesting to read/listen to one after the other (in no particular order). Also, I recommend all of [Monsieur phi](https://www.youtube.com/@MonsieurPhi)'s videos on the subject of LLMs.
