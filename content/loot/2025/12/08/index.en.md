Already the second Loot, and I'm late. I had to go back over my Blue and Red book (those who know will know). Let's go:

## Tech

A bit of entertainment with this Linus duo. Pretty fun and informative to watch.

- [Building the PERFECT Linux PC with Linus Torvalds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfv0V1SxbNA) (YouTube)

An old piece but still very interesting. If you need to create or improve a documentation space, especially a technical one, read this (with plenty of references inside to reed as well):

- [How to structure technical documentation: best practices](https://gitbook.com/docs/guides/docs-best-practices/documentation-structure-tips)

## Society

This show is interesting because it tackles a topic that doesn't get much coverage. I hope they come back to it, with more details and examples in particular. 
Feel free to skip to minute 14 for the real content of the video and skip the funny quiz at the beginning, which I personally didn't find that interesting.

I now take a lot of distance from Sismique's episodes (I'll probably explain in detail why someday), but this one is a pretty good summary and analysis of violence and how we are exposed to it. I like how it connects
the decrease in violence with changes in our exposure to it. I hadn't really realised this shift, nor the effects it causes, especially in terms of decontextualisation and the disappearance of spaces where we can talk about it.
The fact that we no longer have suitable, dedicated spaces, even slightly hidden ones, to talk about violence is quite similar to the question of exposure to porn (especially for younger people). 
Anyway, it's a great episode: it makes you think and gives a lot of leads to dig into.

A very good documentary about Trump's America and how/why Americans vote for him. 
Sometimes hard to watch, but very informative without falling into the "we have to hear all sides" trap, because it doesn't put all viewpoints on the same level.

## Music

While making the entry {{< link "concert/2025/04-18-Makoto Ozone" >}} I discovered the recording of this concert. 
Very happy to be able to watch and listen to it again. You can hear me clapping. :clown_face:

A nice video about the fully analog process of making a vinyl record. Very informative and it really makes you think about all the work required to produce all those trendy new records we see everywhere.

## Train

## Paris / Photography

Seeing photos of all of Paris, including places where I've lived, from the 70s is just so cool.
It's a different Paris, still a bit spared from cars, even though their invasion was already well underway.
