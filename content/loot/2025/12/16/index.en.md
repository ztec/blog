I'm late again. I think I'll have to get used to it and consider it normal. That way I won't be late anymore.

## Tech

Github Action is probably the most successfully [CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) solutions since Jenkins. It completely killed any other (free) solutions for
open source, and start to do the same for companies and private projects. Personally, I'm still convinced of the vast superiority
of Jenkins over any (if not all) other [CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) solutions. I would even prefer it for [CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery) as well in most cases. To be clear, I don't think
Jenkins is for everyone, or every projects, but all complaints I saw about it never goes away with other solutions, Github Action included.

On my side project, I use [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org/) Actions (a copy of Github actions for Forgejo). Soo, yes, I'm maybe not as coherent as I would like to be :see_no_evil:
Anyway, this video show how microsoft pushed the product hardly, even pushing bad quality code and architecture. Fun and concerning to watch.
(keep in mind that bad code happens everywhere, to every developers. It happens)

Interesting take about "alternate" version of a web page. Never really thought of using that to provide structured version of any page in addition of the HTML one.
I will probably try that and keep it in mind for future projects.

The AI side of the question is also interesting, and goes in the opposite direction of everyone wanting to block AI crawlers.
I'm not convinced that we should ultimately block AI from crawling our content, either text or art. But doing it in a sustainable way is mandatory, and this can be part of the solution.
Today, Developers of AI companies are like babies, and did not learn from the decades of work we did in web crawling, indexing. What they create and deploy have a huge tendency to
impose huge load on infrastructure not sized ( and will never be sized ) to handle it. Working on new standards to help those babies developers to do things the right way may help.

## Social

Two useful videos to watch.
- [BUDGET 2026 : EN FINIR AVEC LA DETTE [ARGENT MAGIQUE]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8gCrQ3fWps) (YouTube)
- [L'ARNAQUE DU "MANAGEMENT BIENVEILLANT"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQF3mVW5nVw) (YouTube)


Interesting article that puts into writing many things I see in online activist circles:
- [Pourquoi Mélenchon va gagner en 2027](https://www.hors-serie.net/melechon-2027-la-victoire-a-portee-de-main/)

I'm not as convinced as the author that people are, proportionally, more left-wing,
but especially that the majority of non-voters would turn out for the left.
It seems to me that we've more often observed a certain balance in left/right mobilization on that front.
And that's probably what scares me the most.
The fact that many people will mobilize believing they're voting in their interest but will do so by voting fascist.
The most recent example being the last legislative elections, which despite the mobilization for the Nouveau Front Populaire, also saw strong RN mobilization.

I'm intimately convinced that it's imperative to have the mobilization of racialized people, with real antiracist and decolonial proposals to counterbalance.
Create a real proposal that shows a desirable future for EVERYONE, not just for white working classes.

As said in the article, only La France Insoumise represents these values, but they must not pull a Kamala Harris, and go seriously and all in.
Because half-measures or compromise on these issues won't mobilize.


## SmolWeb

I came across those two websites recently. Should be a mandatory (short) reading for any frontend web developer and designer. :wink:

## Served them right?

This article goes in the long list of examples of how GAFAM and any online provider should never hold any important and relevant
part of your life. Backing up is a good practice, but should not be required to keep your data safe from sudden deletion by a provider.
As it is about Apple, and the guy seems to have dedicated his life to Apple, this article made me laugh a lot. This guy had the knowledge and brain to know
the risks, and still committed.
