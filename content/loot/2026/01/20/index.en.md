This week I'm sending you to YouTube almost exclusively. Sit down, and chill watching those videos that are pretty good. Then read the Ploum article at the end. Or read it first.
One way or another it's all enshittified anyway.

## Security

When a whole continent can read your sexts or the credit card number you used to order Uber Eats 2 minutes ago (I'm almost not clickbait) :-p

 - [39C3 - Don't look up: There are sensitive internal links in the clear on GEO satellites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fM5w7bFNvWI) (YouTube)

Really interesting conference on satellite communication. I'm shocked by the lack of encryption on so many transmissions, more so knowing that they are blasted all over entire continents.
As one of the two presenters says, it makes you rethink your own personal threat model when you know your SMS may be read by everyone in the country with a few bucks worth of equipment.


## Architecture & Ecology

 - [ARCOLOGIES: ces villes utopiques qui devaient sauver la planète (fr)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3laSbTm54_g)

I wasn't ready for this video. On one hand it is really nice to watch, very poetic, on an esoteric theme. On the other hand it is addressed with a lot of seriousness and analysis.
I really like that he starts by stating that urban sprawl is a problem environment-wise. Arcology comes as a ready-made solution, old as a grandma's remedy. It is NOT!

Anyway, I write down the word, and put it in my box of concepts and terms to use in dystopian stories.

 - [Garder sa voiture thermique, bon pour le climat… vraiment ? (fr)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AjT1mC8_m8) (YouTube)

Still on the environment theme. The question raised seems obvious to me. The answer anyway. The video clearly shattered my preconceived ideas on the subject.
Like many, I think it is better to use an object as long as possible to minimize its environmental impact. However there are exceptions apparently, like cars.
Broadly, any equipment that produces a non-negligible amount of pollution when used is concerned. Even if the question, if seriously asked, would have made me doubt myself,
I don't think I would have done the work seriously enough to reach such a solid conclusion.
Watch this video if you have a gas car, or if you're hesitating to change cars.

## AI

 - [La Fabrique à Idiots (fr)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xq6bVbS-Pw) (YouTube)

I share this even if you've probably already seen it. If you're in France anyway. However, this is the first I've seen that addresses the topic in as serious and well-referenced a way as this.
No bias toward or against AI in their current form interferes with the video content. That's nice.
Micode's team seems to do a really good job nowadays. Sometimes it is a bit sensationalist, but never for nothing. It gets better and better. Congrats.


## Transport

 - [Chantier Sensible, l'histoire invisible de la passerelle de Massy - Un film de Karine Dana (fr)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdV5hbRg1Bs) (YouTube)

A short video, without any narration, without any frills. Simple, and enjoyable to watch, to take the time. I would love to see more like this on "ordinary" projects like this.
A chill moment to appreciate.

## Social

 - [L’urgence de la souveraineté numérique pour échapper à la merdification (fr)](https://ploum.net/2026-01-06-merdification-et-souverainete.html)

After all those YouTube links, you must read this piece by Ploum.
