## Society

 - [Y a-t-il un instinct paternel? (fr)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OLzR7UtX9g) (Youtube | Podcast)

I've personally already read and listened a bit on the topic, but this time I find the
many scientific references making the argument more solid and put many preconceptions back in their place.

 - [Pourquoi on vous ment autant sur le Japon (et pourquoi vous y croyez) (fr)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDwmud4RRgU) (Youtube | Podcast)

Related to the loot about China, a video explaining why our media say nonsense about Japan, and
probably by extension about all Asian countries.

## China

 - [Le Soleil Rouge réveille l'Occident (fr)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jrKwNyEyB4) (Youtube)

A short video that puts prejudices back in their place, again. A must-watch.

## AI

 - [Why do AI company logos look like buttholes? • VelvetShark](https://velvetshark.com/ai-company-logos-that-look-like-buttholes)

Fun and serious at the same time. Nothing to add 😁

## USA, Fascism, and renewable energy

 - [You are being misled about renewable energy technology.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtQ9nt2ZeGM) (Youtube)


As usual, Technology Connections makes a very interesting video, and even though the topic isn't as quirky as those two
2-hour videos about how dishwashers work, it's very relevant and well handled here. I really like how he puts orders of magnitude
back into perspective to show the stupid things we do as a society.

But I'm sharing this video here not for its main topic, but for its more unusual part about the issues the USA is facing
with the consequences of the fascism in place. He steps out of his "duty of neutrality" I'd say. Not that he has one, but it's like a
trait shared by many content creators to especially not talk politics. Even though they do anyway without realizing it.
No, here he takes his responsibilities, takes a risk (facing the harassment he will probably endure), and says things clearly. Clearly enough
to give precise voting instructions, without hiding the "imperfections" of such choice. With everything happening in the USA right now,
it's nice to see this kind of content. It's a reminder that people are opposing what's happening,
as BLAST also reminded us in their video [FACE À L'EXTRÊME DROITE, LA RÉSISTANCE S'ORGANISE (fr)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtiqmybJb5c).

I won't elaborate further on the subject, but I hope to see more creators take these positions publicly, and I wish all the courage
in the world to Technology Connections (yeah I don't know the guy's name), to withstand the attacks I'm certain he will face.

## Tech

### Security

 - [Eargapping](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2025/12/eargapping/)

I didn't think Bluetooth security issues were that serious.

### Kubernetes

- [Le premier intérêt de Kubernetes n'est pas le scaling (fr)](https://mcorbin.fr/posts/2025-12-29-kubernetes-scale/)

Just a little reminder that goes hand in hand with [Dear friend, you have built a Kubernetes](https://www.macchaffee.com/blog/2024/you-have-built-a-kubernetes).

### FOSDEM

This weekend I was in Brussels for [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org). I go every year since 2019. (online in 2021 and 2022 due to the pandemic).
This year, the [opening keynote](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/SFKNTZ-welcome_to_fosdem_2026/) was particularly emotional,
with the reminder that FOSDEM is a political event, and that the state of the world isn't very encouraging right now.
I recommend the replay to get a sense of the atmosphere at that moment.


A few talks I recommend watching (as soon as the replays are available):


{{< clear >}}

 - [Evolving Git for the next decade](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/HTJK33-evolving_git_for_the_next_decade/)

Git is 20 years old, but is far from finished. A great talk about the upcoming planned evolutions,
and for me the discovery of Jujutsu which serves as inspiration for new ways to use Git. I need
to look into it in detail.

 - [How to Make Package Managers Scream](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/DCAVDC-how_to_make_package_managers_scream/)

Another talk I strongly recommend along with its 2018 prequel which is in the same vein. Very funny!
The audience was very participative and dynamic. A pleasure to have attended.

 - [The state of Go](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/T9HSYY-the-state-of-go/)

Every year, the Golang room is a must for me, and with the "state of go" presentation a pleasure
to watch. Short, simple, funny, and informative. Worth watching to stay up to date with language evolutions.
Even the previous years are informative, and watching them in order lets you see the language evolve.

 - [How to do a Podcast with Free Software?](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/PUKMWN-how_to_do_a_podcast_with_free_software/)

A very good presentation of the technical and less technical basics of making a podcast. Having been myself in
the position of making a podcast, as a host and for sound recording, I find it fair and informative. However
you'll need to watch and read other more technical resources for all sound production questions.
In any case, it's a good starting point.

 - [Podlibre: Podcast Audio Editing for the AI Age](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/YJSSDQ-podlibre-rethinking-audio-editing-for-podcasting/)

A presentation of a new "audio" editing tool aimed at podcast creators. I'm super curious to test
and play with it because the promise is really interesting and could finally allow us to skip a whole long and tedious process, or
expensive proprietary equipment. The project is in its very early stages, so nothing really tangible to play with right now.

 - [CRA Integration – How FOSS compliance measures support CRA obligations, especially regarding documentation, security updates, and traceability.](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/R98AQQ-cra_foss_compliance/)
 - [Implementing the Cyber Resilience Act - engaging with open source](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/EERURR-implementing_the_cyber_resilience_act_-_engaging_with_open_source/)
 - [The Geopolitics of Code: From Digital Sovereignty to Global Fragmentation](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/XWSW3R-the_geopolitics_of_open_source_software/)

I was rather in rest mode, and I listened with half an ear. So I don't necessarily recommend watching the replays, however I found it interesting
to see that the Janson room (the largest) was well filled. For all three talks. Questions about European regulation are attracting crowds and I'm the first
to be surprised. It turns out that digital sovereignty was quite a selling point this year at FOSDEM because many talks in many rooms mentioned it, when they
weren't talking exclusively about this topic. I suppose regulatory questions too, consequently. We went far from the small rooms barely a quarter full that talked about GDPR a few years ago.

 - [Hacking the last Z80 computer ever made](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/FEHLHY-hacking_the_last_z80_computer_ever_made/)

A rather short and cool presentation with old and fun hardware to use and hack.


And that's it, I left after that. I didn't share everything I saw, only what seemed interesting or quality enough to be appreciated, even as a replay.

On another topic, it seems I've broken all my Masto audience records this year with a Toot. No idea why, but it's funny.
