## The Quest
Here lies the loot from my exploration: readings, listenings, viewings, and other encounters that gave me XP or made me think.
Whether the drops are fresh or farmed long ago, doesn't matter.

Everything I pick up and share doesn't necessarily reflect my opinions, and at no point does sharing something here mean unconditional support for its
content or its author. However, if I add something to my inventory, it's because I believe it's an interesting item, even if I won't necessarily equip it.

## The Loot Selection

I won't pretend to be objective. The loot is already sorted by my criteria, no need to specify each item's rarity, you'll see what I equip or what I skip.

I won't limit myself to tech drops either.

## The HUD

A simple list of items with sometimes lore when I have something to say other than
"it's legendary, go loot it".

As for categories, I'll probably craft them by educated guess. If you have
farming spot recommendations, feel free to share them through one of my [networks](https://www.ztec.fr/en/social/).

### Localization

Last thing, the game is available in French and English. So if you don't have these language packs installed, sorry, you won't be able
to understand everything. If some articles have official translations, I'll obviously use them, but it's quite rare.

I'll use LLMs as translation and correction spells, but I won't put the usual tag here. Consider that
all pages are proofread and corrected by an LLM.
