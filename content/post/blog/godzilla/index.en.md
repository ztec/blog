Godzilla is part of popular culture. Known by everyone just like the T-rex or Star Wars. There have been several recent films
about him. For example, the excellent [Godzilla Minus One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godzilla_Minus_One) by [Yamazaki Takashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takashi_Yamazaki)

Yes, it's a disaster movie, a monster movie, a film where everything explodes. But Godzilla movies are much more
subtle than they appear.

That's why (but also because there are giant monsters, and everything explodes everywhere) my partner and I embarked on the project of watching all Godzilla films from the first one.
To better appreciate their evolution, and through them appreciate the evolution of Japan and probably the USA.
Because Hollywood has clearly participated in the franchise, even though [Tōhō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toho) maintains control over the concept.

Also, the films were produced after Japan's surrender following the mass murders of civilians perpetrated by the USA on August 6, 1945 at 8:15 AM and August 9, 1945 at 11:02 AM.
After which, Japan found itself under American imperialism and has probably remained so ever since.

To enjoy these films to the fullest, and especially to observe the evolutions, I'll try to share
my viewing experience and analysis of these films. The idea is to explore what makes each film special, show
what impresses me, amazes me, makes me sad (because yes, Godzilla is above all a sad story), and brings me joy.

Whether it's about the film, its form and substance, but also the techniques specific to the genre, almost invented by the franchise itself;
I'll share everything, and maybe you too will one day want to watch them all. Well, especially some of them because I suppose
not everything is equal in almost 70 years of franchise.

To find my way, I'll follow [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Godzilla_films) which traces all the films by year and era. I'll watch them
roughly chronologically. I say roughly because I've already seen all the Godzillas since 2014 I think. Also, there are probably crossovers that will justify
changing orders sometimes. This will be reflected here too.

I hope to see this project through to the end, because I'm not really known (by the whole world, but especially by myself) for finishing things.
Let's say it's an ambitious project for me, a kind of new 2026 resolution, but made and engaged before.

Anyway, I'm going to tell you about Godzilla in my own way, \
and it starts here, right now, with the very first film from 1954: {{<Link "godzilla/showa/1954-gojira" >}}

Yeah, I put from '54 to today, but you'll have to be patient to catch up with the 38 films not counting all the stuff on the side. Marvel invented nothing with their MCU.
