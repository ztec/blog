I love Paris, since the dawn of my memory.
I'm lucky to have studied and now live there
I'm near the Gambetta place. It is really easy to find on a Paris's map. Look for a huge green square on the east.
You just found the cemetery of [P√®re-Lachaise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A8re_Lachaise_Cemetery).
Gambetta, is right on top of the cemetery. 

In the area, there is some interesting monuments I saw countless times, mostly in cars from the [P√©riph√©rique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulevard_P%C3%A9riph%C3%A9rique).

The Gambetta neighborhood is really ... full of life. Days and night. Not the busier street of Paris of course.
In france, every year we have what we call "F√™te de la music" (Music party) where the whole country put music everywhere.
Come at Gambetta on this time, push your luck to hear the fanfare (or be the lucky one to be awakened by trompette every saturday)

I live there for 7 year now. For all this time I never truly took the time to discover my neighborhood outside
the streets where I buy food and utils.

Few weeks ago I decided to lost myself in Paris. Recently I willingly lost myself around my place. I tried to make myself 
aware of the beauty of the city. Street art, parisien typical building and street, broken bench, bucolic streets, I think everyone
can see one beauty or another.

![Can I Live there?](photos/CanILiveThere.jpg "no so typical parisian houses")

What a discovery! I did not expect to find soo much bucolic places soo far away from the typical parisien street style.

Since I enjoy paris I often too busy to look. Sometimes I try to open myself and my eyes to see teh beautiful and take a pictures. 
With no order, here is some shot I took. I had to dig in my archives, the oldest picture here is from 2008. 
This is probably the beginning of my journey as a photographer. I started on film, even if digital camera were already a thing back then. 
Will you be able to tell ?

I love Paris. This city is as unbearable as I love it. Klaxons noise, emergency sirens, Mad-ish or waisted people at night.
But also birds songs, architecture and mostly Art. Art is everywhere. If you pay attention, the streets are full of
work of art, from tinny to huge like the unmissable Eiffel tower. From history empowered statues; Curiosity locations; Curiosity people, 
and sometimes rue people; Tourist waisting your time and patience.

From Paris you can go anywhere. Often you don't need to get outside the city itself.I happy to live there
and, in my way, to contribute. I wish more people could have this opportunity, and Paris was not reserved to
people that are rich enough to live there or old enough to have known the war.

One day my feeling towards this city may fade away. Until then, Paris is beautiful!
