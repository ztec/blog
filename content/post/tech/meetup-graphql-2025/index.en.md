At Deezer, we decided to move from a homegrown (not really REST) API to GraphQL. Why? That's not the point here.
I'm focusing on the how.

Here's an account of how we managed this large-scale migration and some of the challenges we faced.

This is a talk I gave at the [GraphQL Paris](https://www.meetup.com/parisgraphql) meetup in October 2025. 
It gives a broad overview of the topic to fit within a 30-minute presentation slot.

If you'd like to know more about a specific aspect, let me know on social media so I can cover it in more detail next time
I present on this subject.
