Path of Exile had a bad launch for their last league. They know it and acknowledged it. It's really cool they communicate that way. So many companies forget about their failure, or worst, they consider it a success (yes I look at you Apple!). 

I hope next league will be gentle and people not to hard on them. Failure is always an option, and should not be hardly jugged but consequent actions should, and they were really good in this case. 

Love you @pathOfExile
