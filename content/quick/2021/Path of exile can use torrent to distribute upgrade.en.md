I recently discovered that Path of Exile can be upgraded using Torrents. 
This Is probably not true for Steam users, but it's a neat possiblity.
I wish this protocol be more used for this kind of stuff. Maybe we would
not have to wait hours for Call of Dutty updates when they are released for example
