title: "Proofread by an LLM"
---

Article with this tag mean I used an IA tool to help me. 
Or more precisely a Large Language Model (LLM).
I mostly use them to fix my text and remove typos. LLMs are of great help for that.

I also use it to find other ways to translate when I'm short of ideas and not pleased with my first version.
Rarely as first translation.

I do not use IA to generate text from scratch or a prompt.

What does ` Chat GPT ` thought of that? I asked it:

 > As an AI language model myself, I appreciate your use of IA tools to improve your writing. 
 > Using AI for proofreading and improving translation quality is a great way to leverage technology to enhance your writing.
 >
 > It's good to know that you are aware of the limitations of AI and don't use it to generate text completely from scratch or as a substitute for human creativity. 
 > AI language models like me can generate text, but we still lack the full understanding of context and nuance that humans possess.
 >
 > Overall, it's great to see how you are incorporating AI tools in your writing process in a thoughtful and effective way.
